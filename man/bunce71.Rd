\title{Data from broadleaved woodlands across Great Britain, 1971}
\format{
A list that includes two data frames. The first (\code{"abund"}) has
103 rows and 45 columns. Each column is a genus and each row is a site. The
site identity is marked in the rownames of the data frame. Every entry is
given as the number of plots that each genus appears in across the site.
The second data.frame has 103 rows and 9 columns, as described below.

\describe{
\item{Site}{The site identifier (103 in total)}
\item{Easting}{The Easting of each site (British National Grid)}
\item{Northing}{The Northing of each site (British National Grid)}
\item{Nplots}{The total number of plots surveyed per site}
\item{pH}{The average soil pH across the site}
\item{SOM}{The average soil organic matter across the site (\%)}
\item{Rainfall}{The average annual rainfall in mm}
\item{SummerMaxTemp}{The average maximum temperature in summer in deg Celsius}
\item{WinterMinTemp}{The average minimum temperature in winter in deg Celsius}

\description{
This is the tree and environmental covariate data from a series of sites
across broadleaved woodlands in Great Britain surveyed in 1971. It contains
both measures of 45 tree genera measured over 103 sites and environmental
data from each site. Environmental data includes the average soil pH and
organic matter of each plot plus the average annual rainfall, maximum summer
temperature and minimum winter temperature from 1941-1970. All climate
variables were calculated based upon the HadUK-Grid climate data (Met Office
et al., 2022). For more information on the sites see Wood et al. (2015).
