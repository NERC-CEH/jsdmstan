\arguments{
\item{X}{The covariates matrix, with rows being site and columns being covariates.
Ignored in favour of data when formula approach is used to specify model.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{\link[rstan:stanmodel-method-sampling]{rstan::sampling()}}}

\item{Y}{Matrix of species by sites. Rows are assumed to be sites, columns are
assumed to be species}

\item{species_intercept}{Whether the model should be fit with an intercept by
species, by default \code{TRUE}}

\item{method}{Whether to fit a GLLVM or MGLMM model, details in description}

\item{dat_list}{Alternatively, data can be given to the model as a list containing
Y, X, N, S, K, and site_intercept. See output of \code{\link[=jsdm_sim_data]{jsdm_sim_data()}} for an
example of how this can be formatted.}

\item{family}{is the response family, must be one of \code{"gaussian"},
\code{"neg_binomial"}, \code{"poisson"}, \code{"binomial"},
\code{"bernoulli"}, or \code{"zi_poisson"}. Regular expression
matching is supported.}

\item{site_intercept}{Whether a site intercept should be included, potential
values \code{"none"} (no site intercept), \code{"grouped"} (a site intercept
with hierarchical grouping) or \code{"ungrouped"} (site intercept with no
grouping)}

\item{D}{The number of latent variables within a GLLVM model}

\item{prior}{Set of prior specifications from call to \code{\link[=jsdm_prior]{jsdm_prior()}}}

\item{site_groups}{If the site intercept is grouped, a vector of group identities
per site}

\item{beta_param}{The parameterisation of the environmental covariate effects, by
default \code{"unstruct"}. See details for further information.}

\item{Ntrials}{For the binomial distribution the number of trials, given as
either a single integer which is assumed to be constant across sites or as
a site-length vector of integers.}

\item{save_data}{If the data used to fit the model should be saved in the model
object, by default TRUE.}

\item{iter}{A positive integer specifying the number of iterations for each chain,
default 4000.}

\item{log_lik}{Whether the log likelihood should be calculated in the generated
quantities (by default TRUE), required for loo}

\item{formula}{The formula of covariates that the species means are modelled from}

\item{data}{Dataframe or list of covariates.}
}
\value{
A \code{jsdmStanFit} object, comprising a list including the StanFit
object, the data used to fit the model plus a few other bits of information. See
\link{jsdmStanFit} for details.

\description{
This function fits joint Species Distribution models in Stan, using either a
generalised linear latent variable model approach (\code{method = "gllvm"}), or a
multivariate generalised linear mixed model approach (\code{method = "mglmm"}).
}
\details{
Environmental covariate effects (\code{"betas"}) can be parameterised in two
ways. With the \code{"cor"} parameterisation all covariate effects are assumed
to be constrained by a correlation matrix between the covariates. With the
\code{"unstruct"} parameterisation all covariate effects are assumed to draw
from a simple distribution with no correlation structure. Both parameterisations
can be modified using the prior object.
Families supported are the Gaussian family, the negative binomial family,
the Poisson family, the binomial family (with number of trials specificied
using the \code{Ntrials} parameter), the Bernoulli family (the special case
of the binomial family where number of trials is equal to one), the
zero-inflated Poisson and the zero-inflated negative binomial. For both
zero-inflated families the zero-inflation is assumed to be a species-specific
constant.
